# Orbital

__https://orbital.build__

A tool for learning Starcraft 2 builds and timings.

## Usage
<img src="https://nwj.cc/posts/orbital/orbital-demo.gif" width="400px">

As you can see, you define your build’s key timings and then start Orbital’s timer at the same time that you start a match. As the match progresses, Orbital will audibly remind you about each timing. If you’d like, you can also save your build, which will store the build to your browser’s cache so it will be there the next time you load Orbital up.

## Development
```
git clone git@github.com:nwj/orbital.git
cd orbital
npm install
npm run serve
```

Orbital is written in Elm and packaged using Webpack.
